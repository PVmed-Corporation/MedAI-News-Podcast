 The paper "Bootstrap Your Own Variance" proposes a method called BYOV that combines Bootstrap Your Own Latent (BYOL) with Bayes by Backprop (BBB) to estimate model uncertainty. The authors find that BYOV improves upon the deterministic BYOL baseline and provides better calibration and reliability when tested with various augmentations. The paper was accepted at the workshop Self-Supervised Learning - Theory and Practice at NeurIPS 2023.

 The European Union (EU) is expanding its support for AI startups by providing them with access to its supercomputers for model training. The EU plans to set up "centers of excellence" to support the development of dedicated AI algorithms that can run on its supercomputers. The program aims to help AI startups learn how to best utilize the computing power of the supercomputers. The EU sees AI as a strategic priority and wants to provide innovation capacity for SMEs and startups to develop safe and ethical AI algorithms. The EU is also planning to acquire quantum simulators to combine with supercomputers for hybrid computing. The EU's supercomputing resources are being used for various applications, including simulating Earth's ecosystems and creating a digital twin of the human body. The EU's support for AI startups aligns with its goal of fostering a competitive AI ecosystem in Europe.

 The paper titled "ProlificDreamer: High-Fidelity and Diverse Text-to-3D Generation with Variational Score Distillation" proposes a new approach called variational score distillation (VSD) to improve text-to-3D generation. The current method, score distillation sampling (SDS), suffers from issues such as over-saturation, over-smoothing, and low diversity. VSD models the 3D parameter as a random variable and addresses these issues by using a particle-based variational framework. The proposed approach, ProlificDreamer, generates high-resolution and high-fidelity 3D models with rich structure and complex effects. The paper also explores improvements in the design space for text-to-3D generation.
